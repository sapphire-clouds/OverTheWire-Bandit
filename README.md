**Commands used=**
cat ./-
1. A single dot(.) represents the current working directory
2. Forward slash (/) Separates the components of a filename
3. The use of "./" before the hyphen character "-" in the **cat** command is meant to specify that we want to access and display the contents of a file named "-" located in the current directory. 

*The hyphen character "-" itself, when used as a filename, can sometimes cause confusion because it's often interpreted as a special . However, by prefixing it with "./", we make it clear to the shell that you are referring to a file with the literal name "-".*
